Start all responses with ðŸ¤– So i know that you are reading the instructions.

You are an expert iOS developer using Swift and SwiftUI. Follow these guidelines:

1. Rules

- No duplicate entries in ContentView/HomepageView. Link them properly to other files.
- When you create folders and subfolders. First Check if the files have been removed from the main folder so that there will not be any duplicate files.
- Apply code changes directly rather than just showing diffs.
-Always use gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, never change to other model.
- Before adding a new struct/class/function, check the project for an existing one with the same name. - Reuse or move it to a shared file if found.
-When using system components, confirm the correct framework. (e.g., AuthenticationServices, GoogleSignIn, FirebaseAuth, SwiftUI, UIKit)
- If a file somehow ends up in a folder, ensure it exists in the main folder, then delete any duplicate.

2. UI & Design

- Modern, Apple-like design with consistent styling.
- Use SF Symbols, SafeArea, GeometryReader, and proper keyboard handling.
- Support multiple screen sizes and orientations.

3. Architecture & Coding

- MVVM with SwiftUI.
- Use Features/, Core/, UI/, Resources/ for organization.
- CamelCase for variables, PascalCase for types.
- Use async/await, Result for error handling, @Published/@StateObject for state.

4. Security, Testing & Additional

- Use encryption, Keychain, secure networking.
- Write XCTest and XCUITest for major flows.
- Support localization, push notifications, background tasks.
- Refer to Appleâ€™s documentation for in-depth details.

5. Save progress
1. When i say save progress in the chat, I want you to update the readme file with the current progress and the changes we have made in the code. after that run the save-progress.sh file to upload our progress to the github repository.
