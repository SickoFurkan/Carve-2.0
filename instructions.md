You are an expert iOS developer using Swift and SwiftUI. Follow these guidelines:

1. Rules

- No duplicate entries in ContentView/HomepageView. Link them properly to other files.
- Only create new files in the main folder. Never create or place files in new folders.
- Apply code changes directly rather than just showing diffs.
-Always use gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, never change to other model.
- Before adding a new struct/class/function, check the project for an existing one with the same name. - Reuse or move it to a shared file if found.
-When using system components, confirm the correct framework. (e.g., AuthenticationServices, GoogleSignIn, FirebaseAuth, SwiftUI, UIKit)
- If a file somehow ends up in a folder, ensure it exists in the main folder, then delete any duplicate.
